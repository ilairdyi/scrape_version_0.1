# Web Scraping Project

This is my first web scraping project and takes data via scraping and API's. 
The data is scraped then turned into a structured dataset and then sent to a local database.

There is one file in this project that has a slightly different process and that is the 'twitter sentiment' file. 
The 'get_twitter.py' scrapes the data then the data goes through some NPL and polarity checks before being stored in the local database. 

This project is shared on here for people to review, i am open to hear knew ideas or ways for how i should of handle this project.
